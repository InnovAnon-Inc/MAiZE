# MAiZE
Maze Generation and RPG
==========
Is it because I speak Spanish, and I'm making a pun about corn mazes, or
because I don't speak Spanish, and I'm misprounincing, "maize?"

directories:
- maze: 6 maze generation algorithms from wikipedia
- mmorpg: client-server architecture... not much else. Everything has HP,
          except the ground, which isn't a "thing," yet... but it, too, shall
          be killable.

TODO combine maze & mmorpg
